# Christopher Rodriguez - @yewscion (and @cdr255)

Hey there! ðŸ˜Š My name is Christopher Rodriguez. 

## My Interests

I consider myself a [Technologist][tchn] with interests in <abbr
title="Free/Libre and Open Source Software>FLOSS</abbr> and more generally
[Computer Science][cmsc]. I am an advocate for the [GNU/Linux][intr] Operating
System (I personally use [GNU Guix][guix] as my daily driver), and I love
[Lisps][lisp] in all their forms, though especially [GNU Guile][guil] (a
[scheme][schm]). I use [GNU Emacs][emcs] as my editor for all aspects in my
life.

## Professional Life and Personal Goals

I am currently employed by Amazon.com as an [IT Support Engineer supporting
Operations][amzn]. I am also pursuing a [Bachelor of Science in Computer
Science][bscs] through Amazon's [Career Choice][carr] Program and [Colorado
State University Global][csug]. I plan to continue my education through a
[Online Master's Degree][omsc] and to a [Doctorate][phdc]. One of my life goals
is to become published in an [ACM journal][acmj] ðŸ“š. I'd like to eventually
transition to working Full Time as a Software Engineer, as well.

## Location and Travel

I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania USA. ðŸŒŽ I grew up in New Jersey, USA, which I
visit from time to time with my partner. I am open to traveling, so long as
there is a decent internet connection available!

## Current Work

Most of my personal repositories are on my [Sourcehut profile][srht], as I
prefer a more minimal interface to the one Github provides. I do mirror some of
my projects here, however, including a repository for [code challenges and
solutions][code] that my mentor suggested I set up. I'm looking to contribute to
Free Software projects, and especially would enjoy working on releasing and
documenting more code under [Free Software Licenses][fsfl].
